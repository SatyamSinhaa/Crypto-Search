- If there's an issue with the API or network, a generic error message is shown: "An error occurred. Please try again later."

## Optimizations
- Debounced Input : Reduces unnecessary API calls by waiting for 500ms after the user stops typing.
- Caching : Previously searched cryptocurrency data is stored in memory to avoid redundant API requests.
